Soundboard homework for VGP_1 by Joe Nelson

You can run this project by running the desktop launcher file. 

The game opens up to my unique feature. I created a title card to go along with the assignment. 
From the main screen press the ENTER key to access the sound board. 

TO change the volume of the sounds you can press on the center of the two dials in the top right corner of the board. The left one will decrease the volume by 25% and the right 
dial will increase the volume by 25%
